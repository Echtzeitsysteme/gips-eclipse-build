**Additional packages** are installed for every non-CI build.
Currently, the list of additional packages includes:

- [PMD](https://pmd.github.io/latest/index.html)
- [Checkstyle](https://checkstyle.org/eclipse-cs/#!/)

## Usage/Installation

Quick installation using curl and bash:
`$ FOLDER="$HOME/eclipse-apps/emt"; mkdir -p $FOLDER && cd $FOLDER && curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Echtzeitsysteme/gips-eclipse-build/main/gips-update.sh | bash -s -- $FOLDER`

### Normal installation

**The latest release can be found [here](https://github.com/Echtzeitsysteme/gips-eclipse-build/releases/latest).**
Download an archive for the version you are looking for from the release page and extract it.

> [!CAUTION]
> The built Eclipse version for **macOS** needs further adjustments to execute correctly. Please follow the steps in the respective [documentation](./doc/how-to-run-eclipse-on-macos.md) if you are using macOS.

### Updating

You can use the [update script](./gips-update.sh) to update your installation.
Example usage:
`$ ./gips-update.sh ~/eclipse-apps/emt`


## Runner requirements

Currently, all actions are run by the cloud-hosted Github runners.
All required packages get installed by the CI confguration while running.

In order to run the "Github Actions" pipeline on selfhosted runners, you must ensure that you have at least one properly configured Linux, one Windows runner, and one macOS runner added to the Github project.

Required packages (at least):
* `curl`
* `wget`
* `tar`
* `zip`
* `AdoptJDK 16.0.2.7-hotspot` (may differ, as this is just used to boot-up Eclipse in headless mode)
* `imagemagick`
* `fonts-liberation`
* Github Actions runner
* WSL2 with, e.g., Debian as distribution (in case the runner is Windows-based)
* `coreutils` on macOS
